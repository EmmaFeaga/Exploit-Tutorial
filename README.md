# Exploit-Tutorial
Overview: The "Gone Phishing" project is a 5-minute overview presentation, a full-length exploit video, and a detailed written tutorial, all focused on the exploit of a Windows VM via an MS Word document containing a malicious macro. The malicious document is received by the victim as an enticing email, and when the infected attachment is opened, the macro sets up a reverse shell that gives the attacker control of the victim computer. The written tutorial also introduces the various types of phishing attacks, how to identify phishing messages, how to defend against phishing attacks, and provides additional helpful resources. Recent updates to MS Windows, MS Office, and antivirus packages make macro-enabled attacks much more difficult, but user knowledge and awareness is still the key to preventing macro phishing attacks.
