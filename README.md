# Exploit-Tutorial
Overview: Choose a recent exploit and setup a VM that is vulnerable to the exploit. Write a tutorial about how to execute the exploit, and/or how to defend against it.
Our VM Exploit project will use a phishing exploit that sends a file that automatically adds and starts a reverse shell on the victim machine once they either open the document (if they do not have Microsoft Word set to disable macros) or adds and starts the reverse shell when they click to enable macros in order to view the document.  We will create a VM that has MS Office installed, on which this exploit will work.  We will create a tutorial for how to execute the exploit to gain unauthorized access to the machine.
